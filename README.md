# CY5677
An alternative to cysmart

From [this](https://community.cypress.com/message/143227) post you can
reach  a python [script](https://github.com/odwdinc/Cy_BleBridge) for
the cy5677 dongle

[Here](https://community.cypress.com/thread/36215) you can download
`BLE_4_2_Dongle_CySmart_256K.7z.zip`, that should be the source code
for cy5670 (different baud rate)
